                    When a startup enters the turf of an incumbent company there are three possible scenarios: fight,
                    ignore, or collaborate. Only one of those strategies results in success of both parties.

                </p>

                <p class="article-text">
                    If there is one word that that has the biggest chance of becoming the word of the year after
                    ‘selfie’, it is ‘disruption’. Disruption is about how a market is overhauled by totally new
                    techniques and business models and we wonder ourselves why this did not happened earlier. Once, this
                    was a Google or an Apple. Nowadays, there are newer examples. Think of the transport-everything
                    service of Uber, or smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi as biggest challenger of Samsung and Apple, which
                    is at least as good as the previous mentioned top brand but almost half the price.
                </p>


                <p class="article-text">
                    If you belong to the establishment and such a competitor rises, the first natural reaction is either
                    to ignore or downplay. What would the CEO of Vodafone have said when he first heard about WhatsApp?
                    "Apping is not a verb".
                </p>


                <p class="article-text">
                    Imagine that the small new competitor is onboarding one million new customers in the first year, as
                    what happened with the team-communication startup Slack. Or imagine that you are the proud CEO of
                    InterContinental Hotels Group, which has become the largest player in the hospitality world over the
                    last hundreds of years with over 674 thousands rooms. From the side you see a startup rising as
                    AirBnb, which has created more than one million new ‘hotel rooms’ over the last seven years without
                    owning a single square of property. In one blink of an eye there are dozens of local clones like
                    Wimdu, HomeAway or HemenKiralik that entered the market. The abstract phrase ‘disruption’ suddenly
                    gets a lot more substantial.
                </p>


                <p class="article-text-title">
                    Disrupters are everywhere
                </p>

                <p class="article-text">
                    These kinds of new companies are everywhere and no industry can dodge the bullet. Think for example
                    of the financial world, in which I grew up. It is a bloodbath, or a Game of Thrones if you will,
                    with new entrants that have created new business models of which the clients have been waiting for.

                </p>

                <p class="article-text">
                    First with standard services such as payments and savings. PayPal, Apple Pay, TranferWise or for
                    example Knab. Many bankers thought it was unfortunate that the payments system was attacked, but
                    they assumed that the real value-added services were to complex. Wake up, dear bankers, my
                    ex-colleagues! New initiatives are coming down hard on insurance, pensions, services for wealthy
                    clients, and even complex business services.
                </p>

                <p class="article-text">
                    What remains is the infrastructural role in the economy where new entrants claim the value-added
                    services. As a private investor you should seriously question yourself to have shares in a bank,
                    different from dividends.
                </p>

                <p class="article-text-title">
                    How do I know when something is about to happen in my market?
                </p>

                <p class="article-text-title">
                    There are several signals that announce change:
                </p>

                <ul class="article-text article-list">

                    <li>
                        An outdated purchase- or user experience: think of the experience of buying clothing. Today an
                        Apple-like user experience has become the new standard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are one or two top-heavy expenses, like HR, property or ICT. Think of law firms. How long
                        are they able to maintain their relative high expenses against online freelancers? There are
                        plenty of online legal services. Obviously not yet comparable with the quality of a jurist, but
                        this will change and the cake becomes ever smaller for the lawyers that work in a traditional
                        fashion.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Employees that are not involved: after many reorganizations in the past years with focus on
                        costs instead of innovation, the motivation of many employees approaches record lows. They will
                        not come up with innovations themselves as a consequence. And this not only happens in sectors
                        such as the healthcare market or publishers.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Negative effects of the product. Imagine that you work for a company as Scotts Miracle-Gro
                        Company which develops conditioners which bees are rather prickly about. It is no surprise that
                        there are natural alternatives on the market with a totally different approach.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The vision of the industry is focused on conservation. Take a look at the art and culture scene
                        where limited growth is realized due to the heavy entanglements with subsidy. Many new
                        initiatives concerning the experience of art derive from outside the sector.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Options for a CEO; What to do?
                </p>

                <p class="article-text">
                    So I am the CEO of a company of which I see that my industry is about to change. Above signals trigger the motivation to look for alternative standpoints on innovation. There are a few strategic options to consider.
                </p>

                <ol class="article-text article-list">
                    <li>
                        Wait, deny and hope that they leave. Unfortunately this does not happen that often. In this case, UberPop is an interesting phenomena. Do they leave countries such as France because of regulations? Or will the effect for the current taxi industry becomes even larger when regulations are altered
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Create own disruptor. Amazon did a quite interesting job with Amazon Prime, in which instead of a buying model, a subscription model is leading. The direction forced itself to come up with an alternative, even before they had competition.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        ING realizes that they cannot do everything on their own and work activity together with new companies.</li>
                    <li>
                        Dutch financial conglomerate Rabobank invests actively and takes a good step into the future with MyOrder. Another example the acquisition of bol.com by Ahold. It is important to keep the investment at a distance. On the one hand Ahold kept bol.com as an independent organization so it could maintain her identity and don’t sand in regulations. On the other hand, the thought of bol.com oozed out over the rest of the organization with the result that Ahold became a lot more innovative.

                    Tips for collaboration
                </p>

                <p class="article-text">
                    Large conglomerates have no other option then to get innovating. For the disruptor it is also of great importance to think twice about collaboration. Changes in the world are so happening so fast and very few of the young disruptors have the privilege to independently become the next Facebook. There often is an overlap with a company and collaboration can foster and improve growth and maturity of the organization. Some tips.
                </p>



                <ol class="article-text article-list">
                    <li>
                        The foremost reason why collaborations fail is because the pathway takes often longer than planned. Why? Politics, the many decisions makers in a hierarchical organization or for example something elusive as reputation risk.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I have also noticed that the contracts are most often set defensively. To above all not to lose from each other in a collaboration. Dare to expose yourself and find a solution. Otherwise the collaboration has no use.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Think about you own intellectual capital. What is in the organization that makes it special and could achieve a strategic advantage with it? Are you able to do that in your own or do you dare to develop it together with third parties? This also counts for a young company. Do you want to continue solely and try to go fast or slower because of the collaboration, kissing many frogs to find the prince, but together?
                    <li>

                    An energy company such as Alliander works with breeding places as Emerging Business Areas, ABN AMRO with innovation spaces. These breeding places should have active involvement of direction, including budget to innovate. The so-called key performance indicators (KPI’s) that are used for the rest of the company are not suitable for innovation processes, different metrics ought to be used. As startup it is only interesting to connect to stimulating corporate environments. An example that works like this is Quiver. Quiver is a promising document protection startup that collaborates with Rabobank. They can use the power of the network and knowledge of the customer. It also increases the credibility that large organizations want to collaborate with Quiver.
                </li>

                    <li>

                        As a big organization, start working with new methods that are used in the startup scene for innovation. This is how you learn how (big bang) disruption is executed. Within large organizations there is a constant demand for KPI’s, large PowerPoint presentations and cross functional departments. This approach works well for incremental pathways or for a strategic added value like a patent. Though, there is a whole set of methods that are used by startups and new successful companies, ‘lean’ methods, for example the visualization method Lego Serious Play, and other methods to measure progress. Have to guts to experiment with new methods and practices. No guts, no glory.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Arrange safeguards in terms of legal proceedings or internal branding police. A direction lets innovation pass through the usual administrative channels with the expectation that these challenges will be overcome, and the problems will be solved internally. Yet, this is not the case. You cannot expect that this just happens. You should be on top of it and guide actively.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Conclusion


                </p>

                <p class="article-text">
                    In order to create new experiences a collaboration with disruptors is a must have for many large companies. Outsiders think different, move faster and are not afraid to fail. However, as a large company you need to be ready to do so. It takes more than a few 100K investments in an external acceleration program as disguised sponsoring. It has to start with the determination that it is better to act on changes in the market in a collaborative model. If that mindset and model is all set, you can be a part of the renaissance in your industry. Because it is coming, with or without you. It is safe that your preference will go out to ‘with you’.
